# Postprocessing
This code can be used to transformed the raw data from preprocessing into meaningful images. There are three main objects to be used, each saved within a respective file.
## Staircase object
This object can be used for analytical and numerical understanding of the staircase model. It provides an alternative to the time-consuming stochastic simulations obtained in the Preprocessing. This object is vital for the correct functioning of few parts of the AdapDatabase and SnapDatabase objects.
## AdapDatabase
This object can be used for postprocessing of the raw data produced using the
